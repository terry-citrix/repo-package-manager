# Hermes Messenger - a sample lib

## Compiling
To build and publish the library: At a command-line run `gradlew clean build publish`

## Output
All artifacts (the files built as part of compiling) are located in the `app/build` directory.

The Maven package on the other hand is located at `../../../../maven/`, in other words in the `/maven` directory at the root of this repo.

## Running It
The library cannot be run by itself. See the sample-app for how to use it in a working application.
